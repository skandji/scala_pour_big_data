---------------------------------------------------------------- TRY/SUCCESS/FAILURE ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The trio of classes named Try, Success and Failure work just like Option, Some and None, but with two nice features :
 * Try makes it very simple to catch exceptions
 * Failure contains the exception
A cleaner way to handle exceptions is to use this trio. If the code succeeds, we return a Success object with the result and if 
it fails, we pass the error in a Failure object.
